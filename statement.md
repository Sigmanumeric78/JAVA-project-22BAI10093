>>Problem Statement

Engineering and science students often require a diverse set of mathematical tools to solve coursework problems ranging from linear algebra to circuit analysis (complex numbers).

Physical scientific calculators are often limited by small screens and cumbersome button combinations for operations like matrix multiplication.

Professional software (like MATLAB or Mathematica) is resource-heavy, expensive, and requires significant startup time for simple calculations.

There is a lack of free, lightweight, and accessible tools that consolidate these specific advanced mathematical requirements into a simple, unified interface that runs instantly on any standard computer.

>>**Scope of the Project**

The scope of this project is to develop a Console-Based Application in Java.

In Scope:

Implementation of core mathematical logic for Arithmetic, Algebra, and Linear Algebra.

Development of a menu-driven user interface for easy navigation.

Handling of input validation and runtime mathematical errors.

Support for 2D Matrix operations and Complex number arithmetic.

**Out of Scope:**

Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Symbolic integration or differentiation (Calculus).

Graphing/Plotting capabilities.

>>**Target Users**

Engineering Students: Specifically Electrical/Electronics students who frequently calculate complex impedance, and Computer Science students working with matrices.

Mathematics Students: For checking results of linear algebra or trigonometry problems.

Educators: As a simple demonstration tool for algorithmic math logic.

>>**High-Level Features**

Multi-Mode Calculation Engine: Seamlessly switch between four distinct mathematical modes (Arithmetic, Complex, Matrix, Linear Solver).

Fractional Converter: A utility feature that translates floating-point results into human-readable fractions.

Dynamic Matrix Handling: Allows users to input matrices of custom sizes (rows/cols) rather than being fixed to 3x3 or 4x4.

Equation Solver: A dedicated module for finding unique solutions to systems of linear equations.
